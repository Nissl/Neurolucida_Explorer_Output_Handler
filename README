This is a set of scripts that processes Neurolucida/Neurolucida Explorer Output more 
efficiently. Right now, Neurolucida Explorer returns a large number of spreadsheets for
one cell at a time. At a minimum, this output requires the user to open hundreds of 
spreadsheets and copy-paste repeatedly. This is really slow if you have hundreds of cells 
and there is a large chance of human error creeping in. Some of these spreadsheets require 
additional processing to get at data features of significant interest (e.g. averages, maximum 
values). This is a major reason most Golgi, dye injection, and glial morphology papers 
typically report only a few parameters. This significantly limits the available information 
on cell morphology in neuroanatomy and functional papers.

Much of the data produced by these scripts will be presented in an upcoming paper, 
Morgan and Amaral 2013 (fingers crossed!)

I'm a self-taught programmer currently learning professional code presentation standards. 
I'd love to get feedback on my code!
I elected to leave these files in a modular format so people can select the analyses 
they are interested in. The commented text at the top of each module should explain the 
input and output.
I probably don't have time to create a GUI for this, so feel free to do so.

Also, if you work with MicroBrightField, I'd love to see these analyses incorporated into 
the Neurolucida software. Get in touch with me any time!

Setting up your computer to run these programs
This program is written in Python 2.6-2.7.  

Step 1: Install Python 2.7.3 from here: http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/
On the page, select the Windows MSI installer (x86 if you have 32-bit Windows installed,
x86-64 if you have 64-bit Windows installed.)
I suggest using the default option, which will install Python to c:/Python27

Step 2: Copy this program into the c:/Python27 directory
You can also put it into another directory that is added to the correct PATH.

Section 2: file preparation for this program (and related scripts)

Open Neurolucida Explorer 
Open Neurolucida file for each cell of interest
For each cell, select all relevant dendrites and the soma 
Select all possible analyses that return spreadsheet data (should return 15 spreadsheets in 
NLE 9.0, circa 2012)
Right click and save each spreadsheet as text file with format "casename region cellnumber 
analysisname.txt"
For example, "M32-09 Lateral 1 cell bodies.txt"
